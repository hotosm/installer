Building Installer
------------------

The below is my approach to putting this installer together.

The general idea is to run some stuff on mac osx/linux, then finish on windows.

But it could all be done on windows if you have various unix commands 
installed like tar, unzip, wget, svn, and hg.

Here are my steps:

On *unix:

1) Download mapnik-0.7.1 and unzip into the 'windows' directory

2) Download and copy and bunch of other tools the directory structure created by unzipping the mapnik sources

  Both of these above two commands are handled automatically by the 'setup.sh' script.
  To run it do:
  
  ./setup.sh
  
3) Package up the resulting 'hotosm' directory to ship over to a windows machine

  zip -9vr hot-raw-pkgs.zip hotosm/
  git ci hot-raw-pkgs.zip -m "updating package of sources"
  git push origin master

Then on Windows:

4) Install NSIS

  http://iweb.dl.sourceforge.net/project/nsis/NSIS%202/2.46/nsis-2.46-setup.exe

5) Download the installer onto windows:

  http://github.com/hotosm/installer/zipball/master

6) Then download the 'hot-raw-pkgs.zip' onto windows and unzip into the 'windows' directory

7) Then navigate into the 'window' directory and right-click on the 'nsis_script.nsi'

  Choose "Compile NSIS Script" (this menu option requires nsis being installed)
  This should create a 'HOTOSM_Installer.exe' in this directory.

8) After running the installer (and rebooting), then test things work...
