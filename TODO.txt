 * Write tests

 * Consider trying to detect previous installations and remove them...

 * Revise the QGIS/PostGIS guide with new link to "HOTOSM" installer rather than Mapnik installer

 * Add more to the kitchen sink:
   * pbf2osm
   * sample data
   * git
   * Copssh (cygwin/scp/ssh)
   * zipfile of other installers like QGIS, python, postgres

 * Clear out unneeded things from the mapnik sources
   * tests/data
   * headers
