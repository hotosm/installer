Consider trying to detect previous installations and remove them...

Revise the QGIS/PostGIS guide with new link to "HOTOSM" installer rather than Mapnik installer

Add more to the kitchen sink:
 * pbf2osm
 * sample data
 * git
 * zipfile of other installers like QGIS, python, postgres

Clear out unneeded things from the mapnik sources
 * tests/data
 * headers
